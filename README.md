# Welcome

## What Will Be Learned Here
If you struggle to know how to use functions:
> "I need to call `list.insert` but what do I even pass into it?"

read data types:
> "What even is a `Table.list.node->data`? What a mess."

or have trouble following a data type to its destination:
> "I have a `Table` type, how do I access the first person's name in the table???"

Then this guide should help clear that up for you.

## How To Read This Guide
There are several directories listed here. Starting from **0** and going on, they increase in
complexity as the directory number increases.

Included in each directory are:
- a "reference files" directory,
- a README detailing walking through the files in detail,
- a question set,
- â€”and a corresponding solutions set.

## Note
There is an included 'makefile' in each reference file directory, so you can just call `make`
to (re)compile the program.

## Status
Part 0 is completed, and there are an expected 2 more parts on the way!
